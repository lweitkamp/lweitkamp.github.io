Hey, this is the website of Laurens Weitkamp.
I'm a machine learning engineer interested in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Language Modelling (and their intersection!).


I currently work for [Thirona](https://thirona.eu/), where I train deep nets for medical imaging.
Before that, I got my graduate degree in Artifical Intelligence where I specialized in [hierarchical reinforcement learning](https://scripties.uba.uva.nl/search?id=record_29279) (and [published a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00566) on explainable RL).
