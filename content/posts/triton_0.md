# Introduction
I wanted to learn Triton but the documentation is a bit sparse and the examples are just that - examples of code.
So I decided to change some of the examples into homework-like assignments to be completed, and added some more exercises to it.
The exercises lead up to an implementation of flash attention in Triton that is wrapped in a PyTorch layer.
