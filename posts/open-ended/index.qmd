### From the perspective of an observer, a <mark style="color: #2f9e44!important">system</mark> is open-ended if and only if the sequence of <mark style="color: #a18072!important">artifacts</mark> it produces is both novel and learnable.

![A <mark style="color: #2f9e44!important">system</mark> generating a sequence of <mark style="color: #a18072!important">artifacts</mark>. Some artifacts are conditionaly generated based on previous generations, some are not.](artefact_generating.png)


**novel**: artifacts become increasingly unpredictable with respect to the <mark style="color: #1971c2!important">observer</mark>. There is always a less predictable artifact coming further in the future.

**learnable**: The system is learnable whenever conditioning on a longer history makes artifacts more predictable.
